# Gas-Sensor
Analogue Electronic Project

This repository contains the code for a gas detection system built using ESP32 as the core component. The system is designed to sound an alarm when the gas level exceeds predefined thresholds. Developed with ArduinoIDE, the program for ESP32 ensures efficient operation and reliable gas detection. Additionally, I integrated Blynk for seamless communication, enabling real-time transmission of data and alerts to users. This project aims to provide a reliable and effective solution for gas detection in various environments.
